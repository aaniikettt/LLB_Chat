# LLB_Chat

### Aim
In this RAG Based Indian Law Chatbot, I have tried to make it easier for the general population to look up and check the Indian laws and constituition they need to consult after various reforms introduced to them. The ultimate goal of this project is to make an app, accessible to all the platforms, where an Indian citizen can utilise it to remain informed about his/her legal rights and navigate the complexity surrounding the legal system with a little ease.

The idea behind naming this "LLB Chat" comes from the full form of LLB (Bachelor of Laws), or more precisely, Legum Baccalaureus in Latin. This is an undergraduate law degree, often a stepping stone for careers in law and legal fields. It's the first professional qualification for legal practitioners.

### Indian Law : Embracing a New Era in Indian Law
In 2023, India embarked on a transformative journey in its legal landscape. With the introduction of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Sanhita, the nation witnessed a groundbreaking shift from its colonial-era legal framework. This change signifies a monumental move towards a more contemporary, efficient, and justice-oriented legal system.

For decades, the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Indian Evidence Act served as the bedrock of the country’s legal system. Rooted in the British colonial era, these laws, despite amendments, often fell short of addressing the dynamic challenges of modern India. The need for a legal framework that reflects current societal values and technological advancements became increasingly evident.

#### Aim and Ambition of the Reforms
The new laws, spearheaded by a vision to modernize and make the legal system more accessible and effective, mark a significant departure from outdated practices. These reforms aim to enhance the protection of citizens, streamline judicial processes, and embed technological advancements into the legal fabric. The overriding objective is to create a legal system that is not only fair and just but also attuned to the digital age and the evolving needs of a diverse society.

### What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a task that combines the strengths of both retrieval-based models and generation-based models. In this approach, a retrieval system selects relevant documents or passages from a large corpus, and a generation model, typically a neural language model, uses the retrieved information to generate a response. This method enhances the accuracy and coherence of generated text, especially in tasks requiring detailed knowledge or long context handling.

RAG is particularly useful in open-domain question answering, knowledge-grounded dialogue, and summarization tasks. The retrieval step helps the model to access and incorporate external information, making it less reliant on memorized knowledge and better suited for generating responses based on the latest or domain-specific information.

#### Advantage of RAG over LLMs
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, though they still face significant limitations, especially in domain-specific or knowledge-intensive tasks, notably producing “hallucinations” when handling queries beyond their training data or requiring current information. To overcome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from external knowledge base through semantic similarity calculation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content. Its integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption, establishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots and enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applications.
